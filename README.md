# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using various models like Decision Trees, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset.

## Project Structure
- `titanic_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `titanic.csv`: The dataset used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## Models Tested
- **Decision Tree**
- **Bagged Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

## Best Model
- **Gradient Boosting** achieved the highest test accuracy of 0.82.

## Feature Importance
Key features influencing survival:
- **Fare**
- **Age**
- **Sex**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic_survival_prediction.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: Open `titanic_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment.

## Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning of additional models.
- Incorporating more feature engineering techniques.
